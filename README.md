## Quick Start

In order start interacting with NNext, you need to obtain a client
here [https://console.nnext.ai/](https://console.nnext.ai/).

Here's a quick example showcasing how you can create an index, insert vectors/documents and search among them via NNext.

Let's begin by installing the Connecting to NNext.

```sql
SELECT images.uid,
       images.name,
       images.vector < - > 'VECTOR(0.19, 0.81, 0.75, 0.11)'::vector AS dist
FROM nnext-public-data.images.laion
ORDER BY
    dist
    LIMIT 100
```

```python
import nnext

nnclient = nnext.NNextClient(api_key="NNEXT_API_KEY")

# Perform a query.
QUERY = """
        SELECT images.uid, images.name,
          images.vector <-> 'VECTOR(0.19, 0.81, 0.75, 0.11)'::vector AS dist
        FROM nnext-public-data.images.laion
        ORDER BY
            dist
        LIMIT 100;
    """
query_job = nnclient.query(QUERY)  # API request
rows = query_job.result()  # Waits for query to finish

for row in rows:
    print(row.name)
```
